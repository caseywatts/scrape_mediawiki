A script that helps pull html page content from an old wiki into a new wiki. This tool helps you migrate one page at a time.


## How To Use
(assuming you are Casey, migrating from a WebArchive of a mediawiki into the new site lol. If you are not, you will want to customize `scrapeit.js` first)

- `npm install`
- copy a url from the old MediaWiki site in WebArchive
- in terminal, run `node scrapeit.js`
- the massaged mediawiki content is now in your clipboard!
- go to the new site and paste it :)
